# weather-app

This project was bootstrapped with Vite

## How does it works

It is a simple web app to know the weather all around the world.

The website is not hosted because the API calls are made in the free mode and, as a result, they are not compatible with HTTPS and cannot be routed through a hosting service (outside of localhost)

However, you can pull this repository as developper.
